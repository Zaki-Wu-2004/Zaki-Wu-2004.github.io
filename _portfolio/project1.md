title: Time-Adaptive Operator Learning via Neural Taylor Expansion
subtitle: TANTE (Time-Adaptive Transformer with Neural Taylor Expansion) is a new operator-learning framework for time-dependent PDEs that uses **neural Taylor expansion** to make accurate, **continuous-time** predictions with **adaptive step sizes**, improving both accuracy and efficiency over fixed-step methods.
